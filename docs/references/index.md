## Api Differences
The Juno api differs from argo workflows. Examples of many of the differences can be found [here](./api-differences.md).

## Supported Workflows
Juno has full support for all the workflows argo offers. You can find examples [here](./supported-workflows.md).

## Workflow Variables
Workflow variables are quite complex in argo workflows, and juno tries to simplify things. You can read more about variables [here](./workflow-variables.md).
