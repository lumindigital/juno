### Repo Information



Each file that generates a workflow must have a default function exported. The return type T must be a valid Workflow interface that is a k8's manifest. See the examples in this project for a reference.

```typescript
export async function generateTemplate(): Promise<T> {}
```

You will need to compile your workflow into js before running the cli against it. You can nest workflows in folders and that structure will be duplicated outside the workflow

Run the following command to generate your workflows with the cli

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/juno generate -i ~/projects/juno-workflows/dist -o "./output"
```

Note: You must use the full path to the input folder, or the CLI will break!





### Pre-commit Installation and Setup

This repository uses `pre-commit` hooks to ensure code quality and consistency.
`Pre-commit` is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language `pre-commit` hooks.
It allows you to automatically run linters, formatters, and other tools before committing code.
To install the hooks, run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
